**The Problem:** We want to see the entire folder structure of github for a specific repository before we clone it. We also want to understand the best practice of folders and files.

**Why It Matters:** To understand the concept of what the author went through and to know the folder structure.

**The Right Way:** There is no right way. I have always looked at the folders by cloning the repository and then if not needed, deleting it from my local. Until I accidently found this hack.

**Quick Win:** Check the folder structure of any github location. Open any browser of choice and use the https://uithub.com/<repositoryname>

```
