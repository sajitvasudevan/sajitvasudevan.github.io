This is my new central hub for technical writing. I've been writing on Medium and LinkedIn, but I'm consolidating everything here for better control and ownership of my content.

## What to Expect

I write about enterprise architecture, cloud platforms, and building systems at scale in regulated environments. Expect deep dives into:

- Architecture patterns and tradeoffs
- AWS and cloud infrastructure
- GxP compliance and regulated systems
- Technical leadership and strategy

## Why GitHub Pages?

After years of publishing on platforms I don't control, I want a canonical source for my work. GitHub Pages gives me:

- Full ownership of content
- Version control for articles
- Technical flexibility
- No algorithmic manipulation of reach

More content coming soon.
