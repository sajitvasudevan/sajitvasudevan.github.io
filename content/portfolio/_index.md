## Enterprise Architecture Projects

Below are case studies of large scale systems I have architected and delivered.

1. Delivered validated Complaint Management System automating complaint to CAPA workflow, processing 20K+ complaints/claims annually within GXP regulatory requirements reducing manual triage by 70%
2. Architected clinical data integrations across COTS platforms (Veeva CTMS, Medidata) and custom applications, standardizing data exchange models (study, site, investigator, budgeting, milestones) via Axway/Node.js reducing integration complexity and improving data quality and latency across 10+ partnered systems
3. Architected integrated clinical operations platform, optimizing resource usage 15% and reducing costs through AWS migration. Secured $1M+ annual revenue through RFPs, demos, and roadshows as technical SME.
4. Directed infrastructure upgrade, improving NFRs through performance optimizations and enhanced observability.
5. Architected medical device data ingestion pipeline for MS patient treatment adherence platform, improving signal quality for clinical decision-making. Collaborated with clinical teams on human factors studies to improve patient engagement, reducing device related usage errors and improving treatment adherence outcomes.
